<body>
  <h1>Hello world. This is my first website!</h1>
  <p>My name is Greg and I'm a transfer student new to Illinois Tech, and I'm also a commuter. My major is Information Technology and Management, and I intend to enter the co-terminal program to get a Master's in Cyber Forensics and Security. I'm taking ITMD-361 because it's a requirement for my major, and because I'm interested in the subject. I am new to web development but I do have some experince with shell scripting, and I've dabbled with python, html and others.</p>
